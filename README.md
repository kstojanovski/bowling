# Repository: bowling

Two projects were added in this repository which are implementing the bowling game with **Java** as programming language.

## Project: bowling

The first project is implementation is more procedural like where static methods are used for the business logic.
For testing the game profiles are used in form of XML files. Also profile validation is implemented.

## Project: bowling2

The second project can be seen as an improvement of the first project where more object orientation is used for the workflow process.
Also some design patterns are used like:
* Factory
* Strategy
* Observer

This project has not profiles as the previous one but many unit test which were realized with the testing frameworks **Junit** and **Mockito**.
Unit test coverage is over 90%.
